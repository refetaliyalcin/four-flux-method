the code works from validation.m file

it uses C MÃ¤tzler Lorenz Mie code to solve particle characteristics

Currently it uses Find_R_T_size_dist to take into accound particle size distribution
for monodisperse particles Find_R_T can be used

in the validation.m file;
lamda is wavelength spectrum in meters
f_v is particle volume fraction
h is coating thickness in meters


in the Find_R_T_size_dist.m file;
r_avg is averge particle radius in meter
